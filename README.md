# Deep Learning Introduction in VR
This is my master thesis project, where I explored how VR can be utilized as a tool for learning in AI education. 
I developed a prototype application for the Oculus Quest, where students are given an introduction to deep learning and neural networks. 
Users find themselves in an escape room environment, where topics have been split into separate rooms of the application. 
The user progress through the application by doing 3D-puzzles, calculations, and quizzes, based on the course-material. 

#Motivation
There is a large need for AI competence worldwide. Also, having good technological tools for learning has shown to be more important in 2020 than ever.
We wanted to see if VR can be a valuable tool for fulfulling the need of AI competence.
