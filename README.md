# Deep Learning Introduction in VR
This is my master thesis project, where I explored how VR can be utilized as a tool for learning in AI education. 
I developed a prototype application for the Oculus Quest, where students are given an introduction to deep learning and neural networks. 
Users find themselves in an escape room environment, where topics have been split into separate rooms of the application. 
The user progress through the application by doing 3D-puzzles, calculations, and quizzes, based on the course-material. 

# Motivation
There is a large need for AI competence worldwide. Also, having good technological tools for learning has shown to be more important than ever, due to the global pandemic of 2020.
We wanted to see if VR can be a valuable tool for fulfulling the need of AI competence. 

# Video
This [5-minute YouTube video](https://youtu.be/TvlN-dxAn4M/ "5-minute YouTube video") explains the core-concepts and shows what I developed for the application. 

# Screenshots

The image to the left shows one of the tasks where the user learns neural network notation by placing neurons in a neural network. 
The image to the right shows the visualization of gradient descent. 

# Technology
The technologies listed below were used for developing the application for the Oculus Quest. I used inspiration from the [Design, Develop, and Deploy for VR](https://learn.unity.com/course/oculus-vr "Design, Develop, and Deploy for VR") Unity Learn course by Oculus for setting up the fundamentals of the project. 

## Game Engine
[Unity](https://unity.com/ "Unity") 2018 LTS version. 

## SDKs
* [Oculus Integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022 "Virtual Reality Toolkit v4 (VRTK)") for hardware integration.
* [Virtual Reality Toolkit v4 (VRTK)](https://www.vrtk.io/ "Virtual Reality Toolkit v4 (VRTK)") for interactions. 

## Other useful stuff
* [JSON .NET For Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/json-net-for-unity-11347/ "JSON .NET For Unity") for handling JSON files in Unity. 
* [Unity Snaps](https://unity.com/products/snaps/ "Unity Snaps") for efficiently building room layouts.

# Usage
## Using the project code
1. Download or clone the project. 
2. Open Unity Hub. 
3. Add the project to Unity Hub from the project's location in your file system. 
4. Make sure you have the right version of Unity installed. 
5. Open the project. 

## Try the application
If you want to try the application, you can find it in this [Google Drive for Oculus Quest, Rift, and Rift S](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gGYGSx95d3tFXYZE2iuZ6CZ1LorzNztE?usp=sharing "Google Drive with application"). Installation guides are provided for all devices.
